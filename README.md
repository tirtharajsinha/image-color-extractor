# Dominant Color Extractor

> An efficient and fast method of extracting dominant color from an image.

## Contents

1. Color identification from image using compression method.ipynb
2. Color identification from image using K-means clustering.ipynb

## Project Requirements

1. Applications - Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
2. Languages - Python3
3. Packages/Libraries - scikit-learn, matplotlib, openCV, numpy

## How to use

1. To get a copy of the codebase clone (Recommended) this repo or download the repo as .zip and extract it in your workspace.
2. Make sure you have python3 and jupyter notebook or same type of IDE which can run .ipynb file installed in your workspace.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies.
4. Open any of the Ipython Notebooks.
5. Replace the value of `path` variable in 1st cell of .ipynb files with the path of a image from your local workspace.
6. Now you're ready to go.
7. Run all the cells.
8. The dominant color will be displayed below the last cell for the image you set up in the path variable.
9. Now you can play with the parameters to get optimal result.
